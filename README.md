# Stack_Overflow_Data
Stack Overflow's Data

This is the Stack Overflow 2016 dataset. I'd like to mine and consolidate useful data in order to run them through some supervised learning algorithms. This dataset can be broken down to create a couple mini projects, such as predict and find a person looking for a job, so an employer can target and reach out to the candidate.
